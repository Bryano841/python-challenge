Financial-Data_Election-Result-Analyses
Election Results Analysis
The goal of this project was to identify the candidates, vote totals, vote distribution, and overall winner of an election. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

Questions
Who were the candidates in the election?
What was the total number of votes cast?
How many votes did each candidate obtain?
What percentage of the total votes did each candidate obtain?
Which candidate won the election?

Tasks

Import election results data.
Sort imported data by candidate.
Create list of candidate names.
Create list of votes obtained by each candidate.
Calculate total number of votes cast.
Calculate percentage of total votes obtained by each candidate.
Determine winner of the election based on vote percentage obtained.
Output results to terminal window and a text file.

Observations
The candidates were Khan, Correy, Li, and O'Tooley.
The total number of votes cast was 3,521,001.
The total vote distribution was 2,218,231 for Khan, 704,200 for Correy, 492,940 for Li, and 105,630 for O'Tooley.
The vote percentage distribution 63.0% for Khan, 20.0% for Correy, 14.0% for Li, and 3.0% for O'Tooley.
The winner of the election was Khan.

Financial Data Analysis

The goal of this project was to identify the net total of, average change in, greatest increase in, and greatest decrease in a set of financial profit data. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate the desired outputs.

Questions

How many months of financial data were recorded?
What was the net total amount of recorded profits?
What was the average monthly change in the recorded profits?
Which month had the greatest increase in profits?
Which month had the greatest decrease in profits?

Tasks

Import financial profit and loss data.
Sort imported data by month.
Create list of individual monthly profitchanges.
Calculate net total amount of profits.
Calculate month-to-month change deltas in profits.
Calculate average monthly change in profits.
Calculate month with greatest increase in profits and month with greatest decrease in profits.
Output results to terminal window and a text file.

Results

Observations

Financial data was recorded for 86 months.
The net total amount of profits was $38,382,578.
The average monthly change in profits was $-2315.12.
February 2012 had the greatest increase in profits at $1,926,159.
September 2013 had the greatest decrease in profits at $-2,196,167.
